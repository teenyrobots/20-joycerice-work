                        <p>How can we better foster diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the media industry? For this project, the client hoped to create a tool to help funders inform grant-making decisions that champion new voices in journalism. This tool was to be complementary to the Journalism DEI Tracker, an existing public database that includes organizations, institutions, and resources in this field. They had created a second database of resources outlining how specific organizations have addressed DEI, but did not yet have an interface for its users.</p>
                        <p>The goals for this tool were to allow users to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Easily identify DEI interventions relevant to their organization (e.g. Education)</li>
                            <li>Examine implementations (e.g. Internships)</li>
                            <li>Review examples of industry success (e.g., The Emma Bowen Foundation)</li>
                            <li>Explore related examples (e.g, other interventions in the Education category)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grafs">
                        <p>Due to the large number of resources in the databse, we knew this vizualization would hide most of the content and facilitated user-exloraton based on area of interest. We considered several different layouts before settling on the wheel shape. The wheel shows all the intervention categories at once, organizes them according their point in the media cycle, and doesnâ€™t implying that intervention must be done linearly.</p>
                        <p>Users click on different sections of the wheel <a href="#">uh oh there's a link in here</a> for top-level context. Within each wedge there is a link that opens a popup window with specific examples of successful interventions within that category.</p>
                        <p>This tool was built using the open-source data visualization library, D3. D3 graphics are reliable, easy to modify, and can play nicely with most content management systems. The open-source nature and flexibility of this library made it an easy choice for this graphic.</p>
